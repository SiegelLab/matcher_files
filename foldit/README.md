# These files are used in Foldit to test reverting mutations

This folder contains a set of files that can be opened in 
Foldit. These files are the same as found in the matcher and enzdes folders.
They are grouped together here for convenience. The lowest energy
design from the enzyme design step (UM_13_E353E164Y295_2jie_LG1_1_0001.pdb)
was renamed for convenience to lowE.pdb

Please see the book chapter in Methods in Molecular Biology:
"Design and creation of novel Ligand Binding Proteins"
